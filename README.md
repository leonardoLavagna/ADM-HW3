**Our goal**: Build some (simple) Search Engines over the "Top Anime Series" from the list of MyAnimeList https://myanimelist.net, using Python.

## The files below where used to test the code and to exchange data between group members (see the files branch of this repository)
- `html_pages`: folder with all the crawled anime pages
- `tsv_files.zip`: zipped folder that contains a table for each anime contained in the html_pages subfolders
- `links.txt`: contains the urls of the animes
- `vocabulary.json`: contains the vocabulary of the (parsed) words in all the animes' descriptions.
- `inverted.json`: contains the inverted index for the Search Engine 2.1
- `tfidf.json`: contains the inverted index for the Search Engine 2.2

We recommend to download the final notebook with the files and execute the appropriate cells in the notebook to check the results and carry out more queries and tests. Some markdown cells, expecially those with LaTeX formulas, can be difficult to read in the preview available here.
