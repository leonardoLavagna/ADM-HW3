## The files below where used to test the code and to exchange data between group members (see the files branch of this repository)
- `html_pages`: folder with all the crawled anime pages
- `tsv_files.zip`: zipped folder that contains a table for each anime contained in the html_pages subfolders
- `links.txt`: contains the urls of the animes
- `vocabulary.json`: contains the vocabulary of the (parsed) words in all the animes' descriptions.
- `inverted.json`: contains the inverted index for the Search Engine 2.1
- `tfidf.json`: contains the inverted index for the Search Engine 2.2
## All the previous files can be found in the master branch of this repository

We recommend to download the final notebook with the files in the master branch and execute the appropriate cells 
in the notebook to check the results and carry out more queries and tests. Some markdown cells, expecially those with LaTeX formulas,
can be difficult to read in the preview available here.
