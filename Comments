You should set the 'path' variables to the actual path you've stored article_0 (for example)
If you have article_0 in the working directory just write path = 'article_0.html' to test the code

As you can see from the article_0.tsv file there is a probem with releaseDate and endDate. 

The first part of the code was done with Onur's contribution. 

Onur's part 1.2 'Crawl animes' can be found in the "master" branch. Also some previous versions of my notebook can be found in the "LeoL1.3" branch

I've decided to keep the part 1.2 'Crawl animes' as it is. It takes a lot of time to create the directory tree, but I think it is better to wait
then to try to do some boring and long tasks by hand. Moreover it just takes one single execution to get the folders, and since I've already done it
we have all of them (~2GB)

Keep in mind that the folder three I've created is different from the one created by Onur. A typical path in my folder tree is 
'html_pages/page_0/article_0'.
