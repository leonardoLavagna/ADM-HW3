In the second last cell of the notebook 'mainLeoLavagna' you should set the 'path' variable to the actual path you've stored article_0 (for example)
If you have article_0 in the working directory just write path = 'article_0.html' to test the code

The first part of the code was done with Onur's contribution. 

I've decided to keep the part 1.2 'Crawl animes' as it is. It takes a lot of time to create the directory tree, but I think it is better to wait
then to try to do some boring and long tasks by hand. Moreover it just takes one single execution to get the folders, and since I've already done it
we have all of them (~2GB)
